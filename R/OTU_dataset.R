#' Arabidopsis thaliana - OTU dataset
#'
#'
#' This dataset was given by Lundberg et al., (2012). The OTU table is a central
#' part of the data set. It represents the abundance or presence/absence of
#' different microbial taxa (operational taxonomic units) in the root samples of
#' Arabidopsis thaliana. Each column in the OTU table corresponds to a specific
#' sample (root) from the study, and each row represents a different OTU, which
#' could be a species or a group of closely related organisms. The table contains
#' numerical values representing the count of each OTU in the corresponding samples.
#' The original dataset contains 18783 rows of OTUs and 1439 samples(columns).
#'
#' Here only the portion of the dataset is taken for running the functions.
#'
#' The dataset contains 188 rows and 1440 columns.
