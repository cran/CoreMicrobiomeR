#' Arabidopsis thaliana - Metadata dataset
#'
#'
#' This dataset was given by Lundberg et al., (2012). The metadata table contains
#' additional information about each sample (root) included in the study. It
#' typically includes details about the experimental conditions, environmental
#' factors, sample genotype, location, and other relevant contextual information.
#' Metadata is crucial for linking the microbial community data to specific
#' experimental variables and understanding how the root microbiome might vary in
#' response to different factors.
#' The original dataset contains 1049 samples(rows) and factors like soil type,
#' genotype, treatment, developmental stage and replication information in columns
#' for each particular sample.
#'
#' Here only the portion of the dataset is taken for running the functions.
#' The dataset contains 103 rows and 6 columns.
