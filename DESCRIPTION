Description: The Core Microbiome refers to the group of microorganisms that are consistently present in a particular environment, habitat, or host species. These microorganisms play a crucial role in the functioning and stability of that ecosystem. Identifying these microorganisms can contribute to the emerging field of personalized medicine. The 'CoreMicrobiomeR' is designed to facilitate the identification, statistical testing, and visualization of this group of microorganisms.This package offers three key functions to analyze and visualize microbial community data. This package has been developed based on the research papers published by Pereira et al.(2018) <doi:10.1186/s12864-018-4637-6> and Beule L, Karlovsky P. (2020) <doi:10.7717/peerj.9593>.
